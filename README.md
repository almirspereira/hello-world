I think that I was a computer programmer for a long time, begining with punch cards. Along the time, things changed: terminals, typing, coding, COBOL, RPG... macihnes AS/400, S/370, S/4341, 4381, , OS390, and multi-platform coding with the code generators...The ERPs, like SAP, then finished the programming boys. We were now project managers and product spealists and not programmers. Well. I miss the programming thing and I want to learn again. LetÂ´s begin.
